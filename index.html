      <h1>EMPIRE OF WHITE GOLD</h1>
      <div class="gold-line"></div>
      <p>
        A curated world of refined journeys, sculpted moments,
        and experiences crafted beyond the ordinary.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Travel, when elevated, becomes transformation.
      It is not movement across geography — it is immersion into presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in silence where it matters, light where it belongs,
      and experiences shaped by intention rather than excess.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DISTINCTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Distinction</h2>
    <p>
      We do not offer packages. We do not publish price lists.
      We do not follow itineraries designed for the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each journey is composed individually, shaped around atmosphere,
      timing, and the private desires of our guests.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROCESS -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>
      A private correspondence begins the experience.
      We listen first.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, a journey is designed —
      location, atmosphere, pacing, and moments assembled
      into a seamless narrative.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Experience</h2>
    <p>
      From secluded tropical landscapes to architectural sanctuaries,
      each destination is selected for its character,
      silence, and sense of arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not tourism.
      This is presence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ATMOSPHERE -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
      Silence where it matters. Gold light at dusk.
      Water without horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience is not loud.
      It is composed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- INVITATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Invitation</h2>
    <p>
      For those who seek the rare.
      For those who value time over noise.
      For those who understand that luxury is not volume —
      it is refinement.
    </p>
